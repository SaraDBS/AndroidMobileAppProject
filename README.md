Latest news reader mobile app. Firebase, 2 API calls, geolocation and camera features.

The main topic of my mobile application is reading in general, both books and news. 
It comprises 2 API calls: one for the latest tech news and one for book recommendations based on a book the user has read and enjoyed in the past. 
Extra features include login and registration forms, the nearest bookshops on a map (geo location) and the ability to capture and store book pictures (camera). 
The app is called latest news reader and it has 8 activities. The first screen is the login activity which prompts the user to login or create an account to access the app. The registration screen activity is very similar to the login activity and from there the user can create an account which will redirect him to the main activity. 
The main activity has the app logo and 4 buttons to the main sections of the app. The first displays “Latest tech news” and takes the user to the news section of the app which displays the latest tech news in a list. The user can select the article which loads and displays its content in the article activity.
The second button is for book recommendations and takes the user to another activity (book activity) where he can enter a book title and it displays book recommendations accordingly.  Recommendations are displayed in a text view in the same screen.
The third button is for storing and displaying a book image and opens the phone’s camera so the user can capture, store and display an image. (Image is displayed in an image view).
The fourth and last button is for the maps activity and displays “Books near you”.  The map activity uses GPS to display the user’s current location and the nearest bookshops. There are 5 different markers on the map for bookshops. The user is also able to long click the map and place other markers on it, which will in turn display the markers location.
